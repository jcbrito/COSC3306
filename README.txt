This program is a scene of the classic game asteroids. Most of the shapes are drawn
using the GL_LINES function. This is the first assignment for the class
COSC 3306 (Introduction to computer graphics). This scene was created using simple
shapes and lines. While the scene is displayed, the user can click on the scene to repaint and see
the stars and ship change postions.
