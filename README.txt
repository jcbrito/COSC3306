This program is a scene of the classic game asteroids. Most of the shapes are drawn
using the GL_LINES function. This is the first assignment for the class
COSC 3306 (Introduction to computer graphics). This scene was created using simple
shapes and lines. While the scene is displayed, the user can click on the scene to re run the animation. 
each time the animation runs, the ship and stars will be in different locations. Random colours 
and locations are generated using the C rand() function. 


The ship is made up of 4 different points (a, b, c, d) and are drwan using the 
GL_LINES function. the spaceship has one starting coordinade (X, Y) and all the other points are drawn
ralative to that starting coordinate. for example point a = (X, Y) and point b = (point a X + 50, point a Y + 30). this makes 
it easier to control the movements of the ship as only one set of coordinates needs to be adjusted.

The asteroids are drwan the same way. the only difference is the starting position. Asteroids movement is
fixed, meaning that it will move in one direction until a certain X or Y location is reached, then it will
reverse the direction until another X or Y location is reached and repeat.

The name is made up of glutBitmapCharacter() functions, after some research i found that there is a 
string function which would of been much easier to use, but i decided to keep it as characters since 
a lot fo work was put into making it. The colour is randomly generated byt randomly generating 
3 float numbers between 0 and 1.0 which each represent a value for Red, Green, and Blue.
